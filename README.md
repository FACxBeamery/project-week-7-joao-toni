# Project Week 7-9 (João and Toni)

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

We have built a web app that helps a new Beamery starter on their first week by tracking their on-boarding task events.  


# ⭐️WEEK 7 - 8 ⭐️

## 'Product' design burst

We had a design burst that covered the main processes for designing a product/app usually followed by product designers/ux researchers. 

### who are we building this app for? What are our goals and motivations?

- [ ] Learn Beamery's policies
- [ ] 'Cure' first-week blues
- [ ] Ease the overwhelming feeling of too many events/meetings
- [ ] Give them confidence by tracking their progress

### personas, scenarios. Who is PAUL??

## Wireframing

[FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/file/Dh2wx7l98VUrHOERFe0Xx9/UI-Design?node-id=0%3A1)

This one was especially important for following a component-based software architecture. This helped us breaking down most elements into components.

## User Stories

As a DEVELOPER I need to WRITE INTEGRATION TESTS FOR MY APP so that I CAN PROVE MY APP WORKS AS EXPECTED

- [x] Integration tests written for one or more components using Jest and React Testing Library
- [x] API data is replaced with a mock/stub where required
- [x] Test files are colocated with the component being tested (e.g. MyComponent.test.js)

As a DEVELOPER I need to BUILD THE FRONTEND FIRST so that I CAN DEMONSTRATE THE FUNCTIONALITY BEFORE BUILDING THE BACKEND

- [x] API calls to the backend are stubbed out for now

As a DEVELOPER I need to FOLLOW A DESIGN CAREFULLY so that MY PRODUCT MATCHES THE INITIAL DESIGNS

- [x] Wireframes follow Beamery's design guidelines
- [x] App design matches wireframes (or if not, there is a justifiable reason)

As a DEVELOPER I need to USE A CONSISTENT METHOD OF STYLING so that MY CODEBASE IS CONSISTENT AND MY COMPONENTS ARE STYLED

- [x] Components are styled consistently
- [x] Styles for each component are declared using either CSS modules or Styled Components**
- [x] Inline style props are not used

As a DEVELOPER I need to WRITE HIGH QUALITY CODE so that OTHER PEOPLE AND MY FUTURE SELF CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT I WROTE

- [x] Variable and function names are descriptive (they don't need to be concise, they do need to be helpful)
- [x] Code is (mostly) self documenting
- [x] Team code standards are followed
- [ ] No eslint errors (although where necessary errors may be commented out if the reason can be justified)
- [ ] Logic tests make it clear what is being checked

## Improvements/Considerations

- Login system is, for now, just a 'button action'.
- Improve integration testing.
- Test coverage command should maybe consider ignoring components that we are not able to do integration tests with
- Backend will be added. Mock-api calls will have to be removed and consequently the code will be refactored.

## After the demo...
- [x] No eslint errors (although where necessary errors may be commented out if the reason can be justified)
- [x] Logic tests make it clear what is being checked
- [ ] Set up a config file/command for jest

# ⭐️WEEK 9  ⭐️

##  Sketch - SERVER ARCHITECTURE 

![server architecture diagram](/WEEK9-RESTAPI.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

### available endpoints

- get("/tasks")

- post("/tasks")

- get("/users")

- post("/users")

- get("/users/:id")

- patch("/users/:id")


## User Stories

As a DEVELOPER I need to SET UP MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT USING DOCKER so that I CAN BE CONFIDENT MY SOFTWARE WILL WORK ANYWHERE

* [x] Separate containers are used for mongo, frontend and express API
* [x] File structure keeps the different services separate
* [x] Project can be run locally using Docker

As a DEVELOPER I need to SET UP ESLINT FOR MY EXPRESS SERVER CODE so that I CAN BE CONFIDENT MY CODE IS FREE OF ERRORS

* [x] eslint is initialised with a base config
* [x] additional config and rules are added as needed

As a DEVELOPER I need to WHITEBOARD MY SERVER ARCHITECTURE FIRST so that I HAVE A PLAN TO REFER TO

* [x] Whiteboard drawing / electronic drawing shows the parts of the server
* [x] Database schema is identified and whiteboarded
* [x] Necessary endpoints identified
* [x] RESTful architecture is followed

As a DEVELOPER I need to BUILD AN EXPRESS SERVER AS AN API FOR MY PROJECT so that I CAN SUPPLY DYNAMIC DATA

* [x] Express backend built to supply \(and if necessary receive\) data to/from the front end
* [x] Mongo is used for persistent data storage

As a DEVELOPER I need to USE ASYNC/AWAIT so that I CAN DEMONSTRATE MY UNDERSTANDING OF WRITING ASYNC CODE IN THIS WAY

* [x] Async/await is favoured over promise.then\(\)
* [x] Try/catch blocks are used for error handling

As a DEVELOPER I need to WRITE TESTS FOR MY SERVER so that I CAN BE SURE THAT IT WORKS AS EXPECTED

* [ ] Tests are written for each endpoint using `Supertest`
* [x] If using a database, a test database is erased and built for tests
* [x] If using backend API calls, these are mocked
* [ ] Edge cases are considered \(e.g. show that 404, 500 errors are produced as appropriate\)

## Improvements/Considerations

- More server-side testing
- Integration testing on the backend
- Better handling of endpoint responses
- Feature: Admin can manage each task, assign it to a specific user, or reverse the assignment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker-compose build`

### `docker-compose up`

### `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build`


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test --coverage --watchAll=false`

Launches the test runner and coverage. Disabled watch mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
